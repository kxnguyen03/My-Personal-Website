        <h2>All right, people. Let's do this one more time. My name is Kelvin Nguyen.</h2>
        <p> I'm a junior kinesiology student currently attending Cal Poly Pomona, but I'm also planning on changing my major to computer science after this semester. 
        I was born and raised in the South Bay area, and I lived with my Vietnamese parents and three siblings. I'm very introverted, so don't take it personal if I don't talk in class. 
        And now I'm just trying to survive college, or specifically this class.</p>
